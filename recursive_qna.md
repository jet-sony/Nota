# Recursive QnA
## What about Recursive's mission appeals to you?

AI is the new hot term in the past decade, and probably the next many years to come.
Despite this, a large majority of AI development is focused on matters that, personally, are not addressing the most important issues to mankind such as climate change, conservation, energy usage, and carbon footprint optimization.
These are all topics that strike a chord close to my heart, especially coming from a South East Asian country experiencing these effects first hand.
For that reason, Recursive's mission of using AI to build a more sustainable society is attractive to me, because it can serve as a vehicle for me to put my efforts towards something that brings proper impact to the planet and society as a whole.

## How do you see your strengths contributing to Recursive?

While I don't see myself as the most proficient AI researcher, I do see myself as a person who can learn foundations really fast and who also has an understanding of a wide range of topics. Ie: I see myself as a lateral thinker.
I have experience in UAV technologies, AI, optimal control, computer networking systems as first party namesakes, but I am also fairly well versed in oceanography, marine biology, vehicle dynamics, language and cultural semantics, and logistics management.
Each one of these is not just a term I'm using to bolster my personal image, but topics that I have spent extensive amounts of time in, with quantifiable multi-person project results to back them up.
I believe that Recursive takes a fairly similar approach to their problem solving - AI is only one small tool in a dense knowledge stack to tackle the core issues at hand.
I think that I can bring my approach to problem solving and lateral domain knowledge in general to Recursive, outside of just pure software engineering skills and AI development skills, which as of right now, are my bread and butter.

## What would being a member at Recursive contribute to your personal journey?

Recursive would allow me to start working on problems with tangible real world impact, which I think is pretty huge. Over the past year, I have been seeking out more of these projects, from marine biology to medical AI to language and culture as side projects with other folks.
Recursive feels like a very natural step up from these projects, and I'm excited to be amongst people who can also see the importance of a sustainable society.
